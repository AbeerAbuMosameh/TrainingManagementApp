## Database Schema Implementation

### Program Service Database
```sql
-- Fields table
CREATE TABLE fields (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL
);

-- Programs table
CREATE TABLE programs (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    image VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    hours VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    end_date DATE NOT NULL,
    type ENUM('free', 'paid') DEFAULT 'free',
    price INTEGER NULL,
    number INTEGER NOT NULL,
    duration ENUM('days', 'weeks', 'months', 'years') DEFAULT 'days',
    level ENUM('beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced') NOT NULL,
    language ENUM('English', 'Arabic', 'French') DEFAULT 'English',
    field_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NULL,
    advisor_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (field_id) REFERENCES fields(id)
);
```

### Task Service Database
```sql
-- Tasks table
CREATE TABLE tasks (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    program_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    advisor_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    end_date DATE NOT NULL,
    mark INTEGER NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    related_file JSON NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL
);
```

### Trainee Service Database
```sql
-- Trainees table
CREATE TABLE trainees (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    image VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    education VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    gpa VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    payment VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    language ENUM('English', 'Arabic', 'French') DEFAULT 'English' NULL,
    cv VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    certification VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    otherFile JSON NULL,
    is_approved BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    notification_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL
);
```

## API Response Format

All services implement standardized response formats:

### Success Response
```json
{
  "status": true,
  "message": "Operation completed successfully",
  "data": {
    // Response data
  }
}
```

### Error Response
```json
{
  "status": false,
  "message": "Error description",
  "errors": {
    // Validation errors (if any)
  }
}
```

---

## Inter-Service Communication

### Service Authentication
All inter-service communication uses `Service-Key` headers for security:

```http
GET /v1/api/programs/2
Service-Key: SERVICE_SECRET
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

### Communication Patterns

#### Task Service → Program Service
- Verifies program existence before creating tasks
- Retrieves program details for task responses
- Uses program service for program validation

#### Task Service → Advisor Service
- Verifies advisor existence before creating tasks
- Retrieves advisor details for task responses
- Uses advisor service for advisor validation

#### Program Service → Advisor Service
- Verifies advisor existence before creating programs
- Retrieves advisor details for program responses
- Uses advisor service for advisor validation

## Shared Data Between Services

| Service | Shared Fields | Used By | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|---------|
| Trainee | email | User Service | Link to Auth |
| Advisor | email | User Service | Link to Auth |
| Program | advisor_id, field_id | Advisor, Field | Advisor of program and field |
| Task | advisor_id, program_id | Advisor, Program | Who assigned "advisor", for which program |

---

## Conclusion

The three basic microservices (Program, Task, and Trainee) have been successfully implemented according to the Phase 2 requirements. Each service:

- ✅ Manages its own data independently
- ✅ Provides complete RESTful API endpoints
- ✅ Implements inter-service communication
- ✅ Follows microservices best practices
- ✅ Includes proper security measures
- ✅ Has comprehensive documentation

The implementation provides a solid foundation for the complete Training Management System and can be extended with additional services as needed.
